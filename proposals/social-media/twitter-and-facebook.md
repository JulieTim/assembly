# Stories for posting on Twitter and Facebook

Social media is an import means of communicating with supporters. It’s vital we all take it seriously and understand how to use it in an effective and professional manner. 

## Twitter

1 SPELLCHECK, SPELLCHECK, SPELLCHECK. Check your grammar. Use proper capitalisation. Don’t use abbreviations unless necessary, and certainly dnt use txt spk (Gov’t for Government and similar is probably ok).

2 SPEAK IN THIRD PERSON. Not: “I think…” “I’m sure…”

3 140 character limit. Include #yourhashtag if possible.

4 No need for ‘please RT’, unless @messaging someone with a load more followers than us (it’s a humility thing).

5 Edgy tweets are better as RTs than from @YourAccount. RTs ‘do not imply endorsement’ and we can be a bit more fast and loose about what we RT on Twitter than what we post on Facebook or from @YourAccount.

6 If you’re referring to a person or organisation on twitter, use their @name instead of their Real Name.

7 An @name at the start of a message will prevent the tweet from appearing in the feeds of your followers, unless they follow both people

8 Quality rather than quantity: it’s not helpful to post essentially the same average tweet three times in an hour. One well crafted tweet will go further. It does take time to construct good tweets; spend at least 5-10 minutes juggling with word order and phrasing.

9 Use the RT button to retweet others’ tweets rather than typing ‘RT: …’ – this enables the original author to keep track of RTs and results in their logo being by the tweet on our feed rather than our own.

Get a rough idea of when your tweets get most attention here: www.whentotweet.com.

Don’t get in to arguments unless you’re very confident it’s funny/worthwhile.

20+ RTs: ok tweet
50+ RTs: good tweet
100+ RTs: jackpot

Aim to post at least once a day to maintain engagement.

It can be very effective to be the ‘first on’ interesting news stories of the day. Tweeting about a story first means that it’s our tweet that does the rounds and gets RT’d loads. Scan news websites at 8/9am and see if there are relevant stories. Post them up with a snappy message.

Todo: Example snappy message.

Careful with posting links behind firewalls (sites where you have to pay or sign up).

If you post something on Twitter, it’s probably worth posting on Facebook too (not necessarily the case with RTs).

## Facebook

1 540 character limit on Facebook, so messages can offer slightly more information/use clearer language.

2 Check when the last post was made. Overposting on FB can lead to less ‘likes’ which then makes our posts less likely to appear in people’s newsfeeds. Unless something is really urgent, it is best to only do a couple of posts per day and to think about when they are going out – best times = early morning so that we are the first with a story, in people’s lunch break, between 6 and 8pm.

3 SPELLCHECK, SPELLCHECK, SPELLCHECK. Check your grammar. Use proper capitalisation. Don’t use abbreviations unless necessary, and certainly dnt use txt spk.

4 Take your time. Write something, read it over, write it again.

5 Make sure your post makes sense to somebody who does not know as much about these things as we do.

6 SPEAK IN THIRD PERSON. No “I think…” “I’m sure…”, only use ‘we’ when really necessary – remember we are speaking about and for a network

7 Once you have posted in a link to the text box, and the link has appeared below, then delete the link in the text box.

8 Be responsible – people will see anything you post on our Facebook page as pretty much gospel. This ain’t no twitter RT bag.

9 Do engage with threads underneath Facebook status messages by posting links to further evidence/related material. Though don’t get into arguments.

10 The ‘Click like if…’ tactic can be great, but don’t overuse it and make sure it’s part of a message with a point of information. It’s particularly effective when the article itself is negative and isn’t something people can ‘like’.
