Stories for Online Open Space Technology
========================================

Invitation Writing
------------------

This will be very similar to normal inviting (see OpenSpaceTechnology), but need to explain how to connect to a server (rather than how to travel to a building).

Worth trying to collect commitments to attend, either with a Facebook event or with an event booking system.

Build Up
--------

Remind people about the event.

Provide a way for people to kick around ideas for sessions (but make sure the agenda is only created at the start of the event, otherwise confidence in open agenda setting at the event is compromised).

Opening the Space
-----------------

At the start of the event, the facilitator opens the space by explaining how open space technology works, what the concern is that the meeting is addressing, and what kind of outcomes are expected from the sessions. Having a written script that is used each time generates consistency across meetings, and allows people who arrive late to figure out how things work.
