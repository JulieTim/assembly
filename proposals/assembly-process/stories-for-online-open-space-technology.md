# Stories for Online Open Space Technology

## Decide Theme

Open Space Technology meetings revolve around a theme, sometimes phrased as a question.

Think about expectations for outcomes. What are you hoping to achieve?

Since this is online, rather than finding a venue, decide which software service will be used (e.g. host name of a Mumble server, and pirate pad or Google doc for writing notes for each session).

## Invitation Writing

This is very similar to normal inviting, see 
[OpenSpaceTechnology](https://projects.appropriatesoftware.org/assembly/trac/wiki/OpenSpaceTechnology#InvitationWriting). Focus on the theme rather than the methodology.

Since this is online, explain how to connect to the server (rather than how to travel to a building).

Try to collect commitments to attend, either with a Facebook event or with an event booking system.

## Build Up

Remind people about the event.

Provide a way for people to kick around ideas for sessions (but make sure the agenda is only created at the start of the event, otherwise confidence in open agenda setting at the event is compromised).

## Opening the Space

At the start of the event, the facilitator opens the space by explaining how open space technology works, what the concern is that the meeting is addressing, and what kind of outcomes are expected from the sessions. Having a written script that is used each time generates consistency across meetings, and allows people who arrive late to figure out how things work.

### Welcome, Create space

Help people to connect to the server. When they join, if necessary move people to a separate room (or equivalent) where their audio settings can be adjusted until they can hear and be heard.

Make sure there isn't any background noise (Mute people if necessary).

Introduce yourself, "honored to be with you. I know the skills, ability, knowledge,...caring are here."

Indicate which script is being followed in this meeting (provide a link) and describe how people can suggest improvements to the script for future events.

**Example**

"Hello everybody, welcome to the Open Space."

"It is an inmense pleasure to have each and everyone of you today."

"Let´s take a moment to explore the virtual environment we are in. This may be the first time you are in Mumble. When you want to talk you just have to press the key you arranged previously on your audio settings. Please go to the room ''Audio Problems'' or ''Help with Mumble'' if you have any technical difficulty to listen or make yourself heard. In your left you have a column which is used for chat, and which can be used to share extra information and content, without interrupting the conversation."

### State the theme

State it clearly, succinctly and provocatively

Describe expectations for outcome (e.g., get as specific as you can so that you can leave here and act)

Constraints and commitments

**Example**

"We are gathered here to make a difference. Outcomes may include: improved understanding of how something works, notes about an issue that needs resolving, recommendations for resolving a known issue, discussing and making changes to written materials, a new collaboration."

### How does this work?

Distribute link to online pad available for creating the schedule

  * Pick some useful examples to express the potential for magic

Passion and responsibility

  * Write issue, your name, announce, post, add a room named after the issue

  * When everyone who cares to has done so, sign up for as many as you are interested in

  * Not brainstorming

  * Responsibility: to convene group, document session, highlight outcomes

Housekeeping

 * Food, breaks logistics

 * Evening News, Morning Announcements

 * Bells for gathering everyone together

### Principles

Whoever comes are the right people

 * Don’t need the VIPs, or hundreds of people; just who cares

 * Only one? When was the last time you had quiet time to think and write about something you really cared about? Go for it!

Whatever happens is the only thing that could have

 * About letting go of expectations: coulds, shoulds; whatever is, is; work with it

When it starts...

 * A reminder that creativity does not happen according to a schedule

When it's over, it's over

 * Done in 10 minutes? Great! Move on.

 * Corollary: when its not over, keep going until you’re done

Law of 2 Feet

 * Define it: when you are neither learning nor contributing

 * Fundamentally about personal responsibility: its up to you to take a stand get your own needs met

 * Two animals

  '''Bumblebees''' cross-pollinate ideas. That’s why you can sign up for things at the same time; its possible to be in multiple places at once

  '''Butterflies''' look very delicate and they’re deceptive in their impact. May never attend a session; they hang out in the coffee shop, by the pool, in the bar. You sit down and have a quiet, reflective talk with one of them; a chance remark may impact you’re thinking and you take it back into the larger group and it affects others.
  
  So if you’re irritated by people who never go to the sessions, know they do serve a useful purpose; if you’re one of them, you don’t need to feel guilty about it – in open space you’re valued.

 * Death to Boars: moderates their behavior knowing that people can leave if they hog air time

Be prepared to be surprised

 * Never before, never again will this group be together

### Do It

Its time, remember, if your issue or pet peeve is not addressed, look to yourself

My hope for you, that you reach your goals...that magic happens

So, I invite you now to come into the circle, write down your topic, your name, announce it and we’re underway

Encourage them to keep sessions separate even if similar.

## Closing the Space

*derived from [this page](http://www.openspaceworld.org/tmnfiles/describe.htm)*

Keep in the style and spirit of the gathering. There are two basic areas to process with people: what content related things came out for them; what did they learn about the principles in action (how does this process apply back in the real world?).

Are there stories anyone wants to tell?

Perhaps new insights into their work or experiences with the principles or the law?

What common ideas emerged?

Try doing a quick "around the circle" question: Name the most important priority that emerged for you.

Consider asking them to write down something that they think would be useful to remember: a task, a commitment, an idea and put it above their desk or somewhere they can reference it later.

Do a talking stick closing: talk about what this experience meant to you.

Acknowledge their accomplishments: They’ve just blow their cover: you have demonstrated that you can work together; give examples from the session; now you have a choice.

Make my request of them: be the change they want in the world: bring this way of working together back to the work place and share it with others.

Say thank you...its been an honour to be with you.
