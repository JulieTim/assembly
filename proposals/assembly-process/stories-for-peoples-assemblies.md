# Stories for People's Assemblies Against Austerity

## Outcomes

*What are people's assemblies for?*

* Meeting other people

* Voice actually heard
* Being part of bigger process
* Creating community
* Collective political vision
* Self-organisation
* Develop and improve process


From Paul F:
* Permanent, standing bodies
* Have the concept of system change as part of their continuing agenda
* encourage diversity of views/representation
* Be prepared to become rival centres of power, playing a role in the transition to a real democracy

Process is important in the opposition to bureaucratic, top-down events, but
a focus on this alone should not marginalise more strategic questions and
issues about the role of PAs in bringing about democratic change.
