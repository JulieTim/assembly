From Paul F:
* Permanent, standing bodies
* Have the concept of system change as part of their continuing agenda
* encourage diversity of views/representation
* Be prepared to become rival centres of power, playing a role in the transition to a real democracy

Process is important in the opposition to bureaucratic, top-down events, but
a focus on this alone should not marginalise more strategic questions and
issues about the role of PAs in bringing about democratic change.
