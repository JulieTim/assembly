#### Roles for General Assembly

* Facilitator
* Minute taker
* PA engineer and PA (or megaphones)
* Co-facilitator (mic stack)
* Mic guard
* Time keeper
* Dragon

The most important roles are the facilitator and the minute taker. A quiet General Assembly can be conducted with just these two roles. However for a busy, evening General Assembly, it is often necessary to have all these roles covered.

#### Activities for Facilitator

Before: Check in at pre-GA planning meeting. Co-create facilitation plan. Eat, refresh, rehearse, attend GA.

During: Operate facilitation plan.

After: Review and feedback.

#### Activities for Minute Taker

Before: Check in at pre-GA planning meeting. Charge laptop. Co-create facilitation plan. Eat, refresh, rehearse, attend GA.

During: Create authentic record. Record the scheduled time, date, location, occasion, the weather, the name of the facilitator, the name of the minute taker. Record when the meeting actually starts. Record utterances like a script for a play. Record the name of the voice followed by a colon, and then record what is spoken. Record when a change of voice occurs by starting a new line. Record all the facilitator's indications. Don't record the content of a disruption, but do record when a significant disruption occurs. Don't record personal abuse. Record when the meeting actually ends.

After: Summarise proposals that were tested for consensus, and whether or not consensus was reached, in a separate section at the top. Send minutes to a regular member of GA working group. Check they are put on line correctly.

Training of GA minute takers. (There is a new GA minute takers working group. More details soon.)

### Political Themes

The evening General Assembly holds a political discussion to generate proposals and build consensus for a positive alternative. After a brief introduction, the assembly breaks into discussion groups of about 10 people. Comments and proposals are recorded in the minutes. Proposals are brought back to the General Assembly for consensus decision making and further discussion. Often, a working group will be contributing to the development of the proposals, and provide a forum for extended discussion towards resolution of more difficult objections or amendments to the current proposals.

Current list of themes in which the General Assembly is generating proposals and building consensus:

* Aims: Why are we here?
* Banking
* Corporations
* Democracy
* Environment
* Economy
* Food
* Gender
* Youth

### Consensus Decision Making

The General Assembly working group seeks to proceed by proposition and consensus. Proposals are submitted to the General Assembly Planning Working Group and are scheduled for an upcoming General Assembly. For more information about consensus decision making, please refer to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making Wikipedia page].
