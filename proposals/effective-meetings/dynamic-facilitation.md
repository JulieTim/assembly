# Dynamic Facilitation

No ground rules.

Facilitator follows energy in the group.

Each individual's contribution listened to, honoured, and recorded.

Participants sit in a 'U' shape facing the issue written on a flip chart.

Facilitator is not neutral, they positively take the side of every person that contributes.

Like working on a puzzle, it is chaotic at first, then gradually moves towards a "we" solution.
