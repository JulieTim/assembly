# Agile Plannng Game

Create and maintain a backlog of issues.

Create a little emotional distance from planning by treating it as a game. Plan for work to be undertaken in short iterations. Play the planning game before each iteration.

The game has a goal, playing pieces, players, and rules for allowable moves.

The goal is to put the greatest possible benefit into a coherent plan for the next iteration.

The basic playing piece is the issue. Issues have a benefit and a cost, although this is a little tricky because the value of some issues depends on the presence or absence of others, and the benefit and costs of the issues may change over time.

Anybody can raise a new issue at any time. Creating an issue just means writing a short description and estimating the benefit of resolving the issue (in practice, it has to have enough information for somebody to assign it a cost).

Self-select issues that you are willing and able to resolve. Estimate what is needed to resolve the issue, and how much time it will take you to complete. A useful discussion may emerge about what is required to resolve the issue.

Pick a date in the future when the iteration will end. Discuss and decide how much effort is available to resolve issues during the iteration.

Make commitments to issues. Add the commitments to the plan. Make sure, for each person, that the total cost of their commitment is less than the amount of effort they have available in the next iteration.

If during the iteration, it turns out people have predicted they could do more tickets in the iteration than they will be able to do, then defer the least important issues to a future iteration, so that the total cost of the remaining issues is less than the amount of effort remaining in the iteration.
