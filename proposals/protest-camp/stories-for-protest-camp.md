# Stories for Protest Camp

Camps of protest, solidarity and action have a long and rich history. From 
Greenham Common to the Camp for Climate Action, Gleneagles to Taksim 
Gezi Park, they have provided unique opportunities to converge and create 
autonomous and radical spaces. *(extracted from [Reclaim the Power Welcome Booklet 2013](http://www.campaigncc.org/sites/www.campaigncc.org/files/ReclaimthePowerWelcomeBooklet2013.pdf))*
